# Binary Search in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Binary Search** algorithm.  
Binary search efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.

## Features
- Works on sorted arrays
- Time complexity: O(log n)
- Returns index of the target or `-1` if not found

## Example Usage
```python
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(binary_search(arr, 7))  # Output: 3
print(binary_search(arr, 2))  # Output: -1
